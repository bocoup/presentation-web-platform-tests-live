Each container is actually running a number of processes, all managed by the
supervisord init system. That's typically frowned upon by Docker users, so the
rationale is included in the project documentation.

???

The server is run by multiple Google Compute Engine (or "GCE") instances
deployed in parallel. Many of the web-platform-tests concern the semantics of
the HTTP protocol, so load balancing is provided at the TCP level in order to
avoid interference.

In addition to serving the web-platform-tests, each server performs a few tasks
on a regular interval. These include:

- fetching the latest revision of the web-platform-tests project from the
  canonical git repository hosted on GitHub.com
- fetching TLS certificates from the internally-managed object store

When any of these periodic tasks complete, the web-platform-tests server
process is restarted in order to apply the changes.

A separate Google Compute Engine instance interfaces with the Let's Encrypt
service to retrieve TLS certificates for the WPT servers. It integrates with
Google Cloud Platform's DNS management in order to prove ownership of the
system's domain name. It stores the certificates in a Google Cloud Platform
Storage bucket for retrieval by the web-platform-tests servers.

## Layer 1: Process Failure

    container    GCE Instance
       |             |       
       x             |       
                    err!     
       .---restart---'       
       |             |       
       |            okay     

???

If the WPT server fails (as indicated by its process exiting), then Docker as
running in the Google Compute Engine Instance will automatically restart the
Docker container.

Restarting the container completely refreshes runtime state, and this is
expected to resolve many potential problems in the deployment.

                     .-----restart-----'          
                     |                 |          
       .---restart---'                 |          
       |             |                 |          
       |            okay               |          
       |             |                 |          
       |             |                okay        

???

In the case of the web-platform-tests server, an additional layer of error
recovery is provided via a Google Cloud Platform "health check." If the Google
Compute Engine instance fails to respond to HTTP requests, then it will be
destroyed and a new one created in its place. That new instance will
subsequently create a Docker container to run the WPT server.

This second recovery mechanism guards against more persistent problems, e.g.
those stemming from state on disk (since even a running GCE instance will fail
HTTP health checks if restarting the Docker container has no effect).

???

w3c-test.org automatically publishes the contents of many patches that are
submitted to the project through GitHub.

We had to replicate this feature before our system would be considered a viable
replacement.

It's a fundamentally insecure feature because patches may include arbitrary
Python code, and we have to run that.

As the canonical location to run the tests on the web, we expect this
deployment to be referenced from web specifications,
[wpt.fyi](https://wpt.fyi), and more. We want it to be as stable as possible.

???

One of the strongest decisions we made was to deploy it to a separate server.
Instability resulting from untrusted patches can only annoy people
contributing; it won't diminish availability for the wider audience.

Main problems:

- trust
- state
- scalability

???

- trust - in order to prevent exploits or denial-of-service attacks, GitHub and
  w3c-test.org need to share a secret
- state - the set of currently-deployed pull requests is known only to
  w3c-test.org; if it goes down, then the operator has to perform a fair amount
  of analysis to determine which pull requests should be mirrored by the
  replacement
- scalability - if the reponsibility of running the server is to be shared by
  multiple machines, then we'd need still more complexity to ensure that each
  message from GitHub.com is routed to all machines

## A small extension

`wpt-server-submissions.Dockerfile`:

    FROM web-platform-tests-live-wpt-server-tot                    

    COPY src/mirror-pull-requests.sh /usr/local/bin/               
    COPY src/supervisord-pull-requests.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/

`+` Easier to maintain than a standalone implementation

`+` Safer than branching on runtime flags

???

This server could have been built completely standalone from the "tot" or
("tip-of-tree") server. There would have been a lot of duplication, though, and
that's hard to maintain.

Alternatively, we could have built a single server that had all functionality,
and simply disabled the "submission preview" part in the "tot" deployment.
Runtime flags are too easy to toggle, so this would be susceptible to
accidental enabling of the "submissions preview" functionality.

Docker and supervisord both offer clean extension mechanisms. That allows us to
define a distinct image for the submissions server in terms of the "tot" (or
"tip-of-tree") server.
